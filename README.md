Brief Description of your Solution -

In a sustainable city citizens should be able to use their transport system efficiently and effectively either public or private, so the problem we met was if a person were to travel from point A To B the only way to get details of public transport were to physically travel to a bus station and ask for a schedule and by then if possible only to book a seat and if not he have to waste his time by going to a bus stations hours early to get details and book a seat if not for many more worse scenarios.
So,When looking at the problem thoroughly we can see two sub problems, so we made a smart app to book a seat as preferred with a few simple steps. When using the web site when all you should do is fill out a form with departure and arrival location with times and search and simply book a seat.
